I am Archana Swaminathan, a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad, India. I am currently working as a Visiting Researcher with the V-SENSE Research Group, Trinity College Dublin , and being mentored by Prof. Aljosa Smolic. Iâ€™m part of a group that is investigating 3D Geometry for Deep Learning, where we focus on applications that extend to Image-based reconstruction, pose estimation and visual computing.

In the past, Iâ€™ve had experience with working with Deep Learning in many projects, some of which are: predictive modelling for time series data, image encryption and decryption, compressive image sensing and denoising, semantic segmentation and object recognition.

Iâ€™m very interested in research in the areas of Image Processing and Computer Vision, and wish to explore different applications in these fields as I motivate and prepare myself for a career as a researcher.

In my free time, I like to read books, play badminton and work out. I love travelling and eating different desserts that mostly comprise of chocolate. I canâ€™t wait to go exploring once this pandemic is done!

I'm currently exploring a lot of new and exciting things, follow my GitHub profile for updates!
